They closely monitored both the number of new daily cases and deaths over the past 15 months in anticipation that each of 3 metrics would decline as fast as possible. Doing this inspired them to make an interactive web app using the shiny package in R to better visualize the different metrics. They created interactive time series plots for both monthly Covid-19 cases and deaths in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In addition, a frequency plot for the cumulative number of Covid-19 cases in the 3 regions over the 15-month span was also produced. All of the interactive data visualizations have slider bars so individuals can view the specific time period that they desire when viewing the specific data visualizations. Finally, an interactive table of descriptive statistics was also created under the Data tab to allow for the viewers of the shiny app to become even more well-acquainted with the Covid-19 data.",
